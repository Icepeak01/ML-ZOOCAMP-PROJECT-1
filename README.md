## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Leveraging transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the model achieves high accuracy while maintaining a small footprint, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## Problem Description

Pneumonia is a leading cause of death worldwide, especially among children under five. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and reducing mortality rates. Automated detection using deep learning can assist healthcare professionals by providing quick and reliable diagnostics.

**How the Model Helps:**
- **Speed:** Provides instant predictions, enabling faster diagnosis.
- **Accuracy:** Minimizes human error, ensuring reliable results.
- **Scalability:** Can be deployed across various platforms, aiding in widespread screening.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

### Dataset Details:
- **Classes:** 
  - `NORMAL` (0)
  - `PNEUMONIA` (1)
- **Distribution:**
  - **Training:** 5,216 images (Imbalanced: More `PNEUMONIA` than `NORMAL`)
  - **Validation:** 16 images (Reserved for final evaluation)
  - **Test:** 624 images

### Accessing the Data:
- **Committed in Repository:** The `chest_xray` directory contains all necessary images.
- **Alternatively:** Instructions to download from Kaggle are provided below.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Python 3.9:** Required for running training and prediction scripts.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Icepeak01/ML-ZOOCAMP-PROJECT-.git
cd ML-ZOOCAMP-PROJECT
```

### Setup Python Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment
```bash
# Using virtualenv
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```
### Usage
Running the Flask Application Locally
```bash
# Activate Virtual Environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to the app Directory
cd app

# Run the Application
python app.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the Docker Image:
docker build -t pneumonia-detection-cnn .

# Run the Docker Container:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 pneumonia-detection-cnn

```
Access the App:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

### Accessing the Deployed Application
The application is deployed on Render and can be accessed via the following link:

## Training the Model
The training process involves data preparation, model building using MobileNetV2, training with early stopping and learning rate reduction, and fine-tuning.

Running the Training Script
Ensure Dependencies are Installed:
``` bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```
Run the Training Script:
``` bash
python scripts/train.py
```

Model Saving:

The trained model is saved in the app/model/ directory as mobilenetv2_pneumonia_model.h5.

## Model Evaluation
After training, the model was evaluated on the test dataset with the following results:
